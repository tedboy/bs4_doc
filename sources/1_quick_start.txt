Quick Start
===========

Here's an HTML document I'll be using as an example throughout this
document. It's part of a story from `Alice in Wonderland`::

 html_doc = """
 <html><head><title>The Dormouse's story</title></head>
 <body>
 <p class="title"><b>The Dormouse's story</b></p>

 <p class="story">Once upon a time there were three little sisters; and their names were
 <a href="http://example.com/elsie" class="sister" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
 <a href="http://example.com/lacie" class="sister" id="link2">Lacie</a> and
 <a href="http://example.com/tillie" class="sister" id="link3">Tillie</a>;
 and they lived at the bottom of a well.</p>

 <p class="story">...</p>
 """

Running the "three sisters" document through Beautiful Soup gives us a
``BeautifulSoup`` object, which represents the document as a nested
data structure::

 from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
 soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc)

 print(soup.prettify())
 # <html>
 #  <head>
 #   <title>
 #    The Dormouse's story
 #   </title>
 #  </head>
 #  <body>
 #   <p class="title">
 #    <b>
 #     The Dormouse's story
 #    </b>
 #   </p>
 #   <p class="story">
 #    Once upon a time there were three little sisters; and their names were
 #    <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">
 #     Elsie
 #    </a>
 #    ,
 #    <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">
 #     Lacie
 #    </a>
 #    and
 #    <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link2">
 #     Tillie
 #    </a>
 #    ; and they lived at the bottom of a well.
 #   </p>
 #   <p class="story">
 #    ...
 #   </p>
 #  </body>
 # </html>

Here are some simple ways to navigate that data structure::

 soup.title
 # <title>The Dormouse's story</title>

 soup.title.name
 # u'title'

 soup.title.string
 # u'The Dormouse's story'

 soup.title.parent.name
 # u'head'

 soup.p
 # <p class="title"><b>The Dormouse's story</b></p>

 soup.p['class']
 # u'title'

 soup.a
 # <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>

 soup.find_all('a')
 # [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
 #  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>,
 #  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>]

 soup.find(id="link3")
 # <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>

One common task is extracting all the URLs found within a page's <a> tags::

 for link in soup.find_all('a'):
     print(link.get('href'))
 # http://example.com/elsie
 # http://example.com/lacie
 # http://example.com/tillie

Another common task is extracting all the text from a page::

 print(soup.get_text())
 # The Dormouse's story
 #
 # The Dormouse's story
 #
 # Once upon a time there were three little sisters; and their names were
 # Elsie,
 # Lacie and
 # Tillie;
 # and they lived at the bottom of a well.
 #
