`Beautiful Soup <http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/>`_ is a
Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works
with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating,
searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers
hours or days of work.

These instructions illustrate all major features of Beautiful Soup 4,
with examples. I show you what the library is good for, how it works,
how to use it, how to make it do what you want, and what to do when it
violates your expectations.

The examples in this documentation should work the same way in Python
2.7 and Python 3.2.

You might be looking for the documentation for `Beautiful Soup 3
<http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs3/documentation.html>`_.
If so, you should know that Beautiful Soup 3 is no longer being
developed, and that Beautiful Soup 4 is recommended for all new
projects. If you want to learn about the differences between Beautiful
Soup 3 and Beautiful Soup 4, see :ref:`porting_to_bs4`.
